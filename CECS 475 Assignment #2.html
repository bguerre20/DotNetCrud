<p>1.  The database <a href="http://web.csulb.edu/~pnguyen/cecs475/labs/SchoolDB.mdf">SchoolDB</a>&nbsp; has has different  tables, stored procedures and views. The SchoolDB database design is shown  below:</p>

<p><img src="./CECS 475 Assignment #2_files/schoolda.jpg" alt="school data base diagram" width="550" height="366"></p>
<p>As you can see in the above figure that  SchoolDB database includes tables with following relationship.</p>
<div class="bullet_point">
  <div class="point">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>One-to-One:</strong> Student and StudentAddress have a one-to-one relationship eg. Student has zero or one StudentAddress.</li>
      <li><strong>One-to-Many:</strong> Standard and Teacher have a one-to-many relationship eg. many Teachers can be associate with one Standard.</li>
      <li><strong>Many-to-Many:</strong> Student and   Course have a many-to-many relationship using StudentCourse table where   StudentCourse table includes StudentId and CourseId. So one student can   join many courses and one course also can have many students. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Below is the Entity Data Model (EDM) for SchoolDB database.</p>

Address2 = "345 aaa",<br>
City = "Long Beach",<br>
State = "California"<br>
<br>
Student name = "bbb bbb";<br>
Address1 = "123 bbb",<br>
Address2 = "123 bbb",<br>
City = "Long Beach",<br>

    </li>
    <li>Display two students</li>

    <li>Delete the address of student "aaa aaa"</li>
    <li>Display the student "aaa aaa"<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>One-to-Many (Standard and Student)
    <ul>

        stda1.StandardName = "FT";<br>
stda1.Description = "Full- time Instructor";<br>
stda2.StandardName = "PT";<br>
